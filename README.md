# express-sandbox

This project is inactive for now. It was a training exercise.

If/when I pick it up again, I would like to add these features:

* Upgrade to latest Express version
* Write a template renderer that can take a nested object with arrays and render with Handlebars.
* Integrate with contentful CMS.
