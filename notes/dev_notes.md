# Dev notes for express training

## 4/3/2015

Trying to match versions used in current HEAD of master of asthmapolis-server as of today.

Starting with an old version of express-generator, looks like the 3.0.0 tag still uses 3.x of express, so close enough.

```
npm install express-generator@3.0.0 -g
express wwwroot --css less
```
